As a matter of craftsmanship, the petition for certiorari, principally penned by Chapman Law School\u2019s John Eastman, is superior to other pleadings that the campaign has generated. It also addresses matters of great significance for Americans concerned about election integrity. In an era when the Left has largely succeeded in its push to liberalize voting rules, such that absentee voting, including no-excuse mail-in voting, is now widely used, the issues raised deserve consideration &#8212; especially by Congress and state legislatures.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__inner\"><span class=\"ad-unit--inline__label\">Advertisement<\/span> <\/p>\n<div class=\"dfp-ad dfp-inline_1_mobile\" >\n<div data-react-component=\"AdUnitVisibility\" data-unit=\"inline_1_mobile\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" class=\"\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Yet the petition falls woefully short as a legal application to the nation\u2019s highest court.

Those earlier rounds, too, are essentially ignored as if they never happened &#8212; as if the president expects the Supreme Court to examine his grievances on tabula rasa, taking no notice of earlier

\u201crigged.\u201d And, without having established that the alleged misconduct materially affected the outcome of the election, much less resulted in massive fraud, the campaign would have the high court nullify the election, disenfranchise 6.8 million Pennsylvanians, and delegate the state legislature to select new electors &#8212; never mind that the electors have already been chosen by popular election, been certified under state law, and cast their votes pursuant to federal law.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__inner\"><span

data-lazy-load=\"true\" class=\"\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<p>The campaign alleges three failures by state officials to comply with Pennsylvania\u2019s election laws, and incorporates a fourth that (as we have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/2020\/11\/could-pennsylvania-vote-hinge-on-a-supreme-court-call\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repeatedly noted<\/a>) is already before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to grant review. The four claimed improprieties are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The prohibition on what is alleged to be statutorily-directed signature review &#8212; i.e., the comparison between the voter\u2019s signatures as they appear on file and on the outside ballot envelope &#8212; just 11 days before the election.<\/li>\n<li>Election officials\u2019 prevention of meaningful monitoring by campaign and party poll-watchers of the ballot-canvassing procedures.<\/li>\n<li>The counting of ballots as to which voters failed to \u201cfill out, date, and sign\u201d the declaration on the outer envelope, as statute prescribes.<\/li>\n<li>The state supreme court\u2019s extension by three days beyond Election Day of the statutory deadline for election officials to receive and count ballots (the case already before the Supreme Court).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Suffice it to say that these allegations raise important election-integrity issues. They ought to be addressed. Many of us agree (certainly, I do) that mail-in voting is rife with potential for fraud. I would like to return to the norm of in-person voting on Election Day (make it two or three consecutive days if that\u2019s more realistic for accommodating approximately 160 million voters). Let absentee voting be the non-preferred exception it has traditionally been, permissible only based on a worthy excuse. We should all vote at the same time based on the same available information. Progressive opinion, which punches above its weight, runs against this. I\u2019d be delighted to have that debate. If not, or at least in the meantime, we should be able to make the point that if we are going to have mail-in voting, then that argues for <em>ratcheting up<\/em> election-integrity provisions, not further loosening them, as courts and bureaucrats, especially in blue states, are wont to do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"jwplayer-inline\" data-component=\"jwplayerInline\">\n<p class=\"jwplayer-inline--title\" data-video-title data-prefix=\"NOW WATCH\">\n<div class=\"video-wrapper jw-player-container\" data-component=\"jwplayer\"><div class=\"video-container\"><div class=\"player-container\">\n\t\t\t<div id='jwplayer_XtkmEUkk_8HR1M1dH_div'><\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type='text\/javascript' src='https:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/libraries\/8HR1M1dH.js'><\/script>\n\t\t\t<script type='text\/javascript'>\n\t\t\t\tfunction loadJwPlayerScriptjwplayer_XtkmEUkk_8HR1M1dH_div() {\n\t\t\t\t\tif ('undefined' === typeof jwplayer) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(loadJwPlayerScriptjwplayer_XtkmEUkk_8HR1M1dH_div, 300);\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tjwplayer('jwplayer_XtkmEUkk_8HR1M1dH_div').setup(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\"displaydescription\":false,\"playlist\":\"https:\\\/\\\/cdn.jwplayer.com\\\/v2\\\/playlists\\\/XtkmEUkk?contextual=true&search=__CONTEXTUAL__&recency=30D\",\"ph\":2}\n\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tloadJwPlayerScriptjwplayer_XtkmEUkk_8HR1M1dH_div();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div><\/div>\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/sb.scorecardresearch.com\/c2\/plugins\/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js\"><\/script>\n\t<script>\n\t(function() {\n\t\tif(\"function\" === typeof jwplayer) {\n\t\t\tvar jwp = jwplayer(document.querySelectorAll(\".jw-player-container div.jwplayer\")[0]) || null;\n\t\t\tif(jwp) {\n\t\t\t\tvar episode = jwp.getConfig().playlist[0];\n\t\t\t\tvar pubdate = new Date(episode.pubdate * 1000);\n\t\t\t\tvar prelimMonth = pubdate.getUTCMonth() + 1;\n\t\t\t\tvar month = prelimMonth.length > 1 ? prelimMonth : \"0\" + prelimMonth;\n\t\t\t\tvar prelimDate = pubdate.getUTCDate();\n\t\t\t\tvar date = prelimDate.length > 1 ? prelimDate : \"0\" + prelimDate;\n\t\t\t\tvar finalDate = pubdate.getUTCFullYear() + \"-\" + month + \"-\" + date;\n\t\t\t\tvar title = episode.title;\n\t\t\t\tvar labelMapping = \"c3=\\\"nationalreview\\\", c4=\\\"*null\\\", c6=\\\"*null\\\", ns_st_st=\\\"National Review\\\", ns_st_pu=\\\"National Review\\\", ns_st_pr=\\\"\" + title + \"\\\", ns_st_ep=\\\"\" + title + \"\\\", ns_st_sn=\\\"*null\\\", ns_st_en=\\\"*null\\\", ns_st_ge=\\\"News\\\", ns_st_ia=\\\"0\\\", ns_st_ce=\\\"0\\\", ns_st_ddt=\\\"\" + finalDate + \"\\\", ns_st_tdt=\\\"*null\\\"\";\n\n\t\t\t\tjwp.on(\"ready\", function () {\n\t\t\t\t\tns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwp, {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublisherId: \"23390304\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabelmapping: labelMapping,\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t})();\n\t<\/script>\n\t<\/div>\n<p>All that said, though, what I\u2019ve just described is a <em>prospective<\/em> project.

Gore<\/em> (2000) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/supct\/pdf\/00-949P.ZC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concurrence<\/a> (joined by justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia). To wit, the Constitution\u2019s Electors Clause (Art. II, Sec. 1, Cl. 2) empowers the state legislatures to determine the \u201cManner\u201d of appointing presidential electors; and, as Chief Justice Rehnquist put it, \u201ca significant departure from the legislative scheme for appointing Presidential electors presents a federal constitutional question\u201d &#8212; i.e., one fit for resolution by the federal courts.<\/p>\n<p>Though not a majority opinion, the Rehnquist formulation arguably contradicts the reasoning of Trump-appointed federal district judge Brett H. Ludwig, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/2020\/12\/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruled against the campaign in Wisconsin<\/a>. (The petition does not make such an argument, there being scarce mention of decisions that have gone against the campaign.) Judge Ludwig reasoned that the campaign\u2019s Electors Clause theory confounded the <em>manner<\/em> of conducting elections, which he narrowly construed to mean the mode of popular election, with <em>means<\/em> by which popular elections are administered, which he took to be of scant concern for federal courts.

As district judge Matthew Brann <a href=\"https:\/\/pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com\/147\/127057\/15517440654.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recounted<\/a> in rejecting the campaign\u2019s post-election challenges, \u201c<em>Bognet<\/em> held that only the [Pennsylvania] General Assembly had standing to raise claims under the Elections and Electors Clauses. . . . This ruling effectively shut the door on Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations under those clauses of the Constitution.\u201d Consequently, the campaign dropped from its original complaint most of the Electors Clause claims, which centered on the allegation that poll watchers were denied meaningful access to canvassing &#8212; one of the claims it now asks the Supreme Court to review. Then, after filing its first amended complaint (FAC), the campaign forfeited its remaining Electors Clause claim. As Judge Brann observed:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Plaintiffs acknowledge that under the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bognet<\/em>, this Court cannot find that Plaintiffs have standing for their Elections and Electors Clauses claim in the FAC. Plaintiffs represent that they have included this claim in the FAC to preserve the argument for appellate review. Because Plaintiffs have made this concession, and because the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bognet <\/em>is clear, this Court dismisses Count II for lack of standing without further discussion.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, when the campaign moved on to appellate review, it did not seek to press the Electors Clause claims. As the Third Circuit noted:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Campaign does not even challenge the dismissal of Counts Three, Five, and Nine, the Electors and Elections Clause counts. It concedes that under our recent decision, it lacks standing to pursue alleged violations of those clauses. <em>Bognet v. Sec\u2019y Commonwealth of Pa. . . .<\/em> Given its concession, we need not consider the issue anymore.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now, in the campaign\u2019s Supreme Court petition, the word \u201cBognet\u201d does not appear. There is no discussion of the controlling case in the Circuit on the question of whether the campaign has standing to raise its claims &#8212; notwithstanding that the Third Circuit\u2019s unanimous opinion (written by that tribunal\u2019s chief judge) relies heavily on Supreme Court precedent. Neither is there in the campaign\u2019s petition to the higher court any allusion to the fact that, in the lower courts, the campaign forfeited and then failed to appeal its Electors Clause claims. In litigation, you can\u2019t get around fatal defects by not mentioning them.<\/p>\n<p>Even putting that aside, the campaign would lose on the three allegations it presses in the petition. (I won\u2019t belabor the fourth claim, regarding what I believe is the state supreme court\u2019s unjustifiable three-day extension &#8212; the petition does not rehash it, and we\u2019ve already covered it extensively, including (a) the suggestion of the claim\u2019s merit by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/20pdf\/20-542_i3dj.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three members of the Supreme Court<\/a>, but also (b) the fact that it involves fewer than 10,000 ballots and thus would have made no difference in the outcome of an election Biden won by over 80,000.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"nr-heading\">Signature Verification<\/p>\n<p>The campaign is simply wrong in its claims about signature review. The theory of its claim is that, in eliminating signature review, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar effectively amended law enacted by the state legislature. But there is nothing in Pennsylvania election law that requires signature verification.<\/p>\n<p>The Commonwealth\u2019s law calls for proof of identity (an examination of the voter\u2019s driver\u2019s license or similar statutorily approved form of identification). While the ballot certification must be signed, the statute does not mention signature comparison. To be sure, the campaign is right that election integrity would be enhanced by a required practice of matching the signature on the ballot envelope to the signature on file. But for present purposes, that is beside the point. At issue is law, not policy; what state statutes say, not what they ought to say.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously realizing that the text of the relevant statutes belies its claim, the campaign subtly shifts, contending that the law <em>authorizes<\/em> signature matching, and that such matching has been done in prior elections. That, however, reduces it to a matter of discretion, not a mandate.<\/p>\n<p>The campaign contends that the change was made at the eleventh hour by a willful Democratic secretary, backed by an elected court whose majority consists of similarly willful Democrats. That may be true. Nevertheless, beside the stubborn fact that state law does not require signature matching (so Secretary Boockvar did not change state law), the campaign omits that (a) the state supreme court\u2019s ruling was unanimous on this issue (i.e., the tribunal\u2019s conservative members did not dissent), and (b) even before that, on October 10, Pennsylvania federal district judge Nicholas Ranjan rejected the campaign\u2019s signature-verification claim. The campaign did not appeal the ruling of either Judge Ranjan or the state supreme court.<\/p>\n<p class=\"nr-heading\">Lack of Meaningful Monitoring of the Voting-Counting Process<\/p>\n<p>When a litigant fails to file a timely appeal of a ruling, it is bound by that ruling. That is what the Third Circuit repeatedly explained in its unanimous opinion rejecting the Trump campaign\u2019s final federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania. And it invoked this principle specifically in turning aside the campaign\u2019s allegation that county boards of election had prevented Trump poll watchers from meaningful monitoring of the vote-counting process. As the court elaborated:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Nothing in the Due Process Clause requires having poll watchers or representatives, let alone watchers from outside a county or less than eighteen feet away from the nearest table. The Campaign cites no authority for those propositions, and we know of none\u2026. And the Campaign litigated and lost that claim under state law too. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the Election Code requires only that poll watchers be in the room, not that they be within any specific distance of the ballots.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To my mind, the Trump campaign could not be more right, as a matter of logic, that the point of permitting a campaign\u2019s surrogates to inspect the canvass is to have the inspection be meaningful, not just a simulacrum of fairness. Still, (a) it is not a federal requirement to have poll watchers at all, (b) state law does not specify what they are permitted to do, (c) the highest court in the state has construed state law to mean watchers are merely permitted to be present, and (d) the campaign failed to timely appeal that ruling. Ergo, even if the campaign had standing, the Supreme Court would not entertain the claim under these circumstances.<\/p>\n<p class=\"nr-heading\">Missing Ballot-Envelope Information<\/p>\n<p>In complaining about the fact that some counties, Philadelphia in particular, counted ballots in which voters failed to write in either name or address information, the Trump campaign omits the most crucial fact: Again and again, the campaign told federal and state courts that it was not alleging fraud.<\/p>\n<p>The campaign argues that state law requires voters to fill in name and address information &#8212; it says they \u201cshall\u201d do so. The campaign further urges that this statutory requirement must be exactingly enforced because it is an anti-fraud measure, and that it was thus inexcusable and unconstitutional for the state supreme court to hold that instances of non-compliance did not call for invalidating ballots.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the campaign avoids mentioning not only its multiple assurances to judges that it was <em>not alleging that voters were engaged in fraud<\/em>, but also the salience of fraud under state law, as interpreted by the courts. That is, the campaign argues as if the state supreme court had said that statutory fill-in-the-blanks requirements don\u2019t matter. To the contrary, the court relied on a longstanding principle of Pennsylvania law: <em>If there is proof of fraud<\/em><strong>,<\/strong> ballots will be invalidated for failure to fill in name and address information; but <em>if fraud is not alleged or proved<\/em>, the state\u2019s default position is that votes should be counted and non-compliance with technical requirements will be overlooked<em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Absent fraud, the court stressed, this is a minor issue: The ballots come with pre-printed name and address information (and, as noted above, there is a verification requirement, though no signature matching). While voters should nevertheless write in the information where indicated, some &#8212; as the courts have noted &#8212; undoubtedly fail to do this because they assume it\u2019s unnecessary if the printed information is correct.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, as the Third Circuit held (my italics):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Campaign cannot use this [federal] lawsuit to collaterally attack those prior rulings [that found against it on the same issues]. On Counts One, Two, Four, and Six, the Campaign has already litigated whether ballots that lack a handwritten name, address, or date on the outer envelope must be disqualified. . . . The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled against the Campaign, holding: \u201c[T]he Election Code does not require boards of elections to disqualify mail-in or absentee ballots submitted by qualified electors who signed the declaration on their ballot\u2019s outer envelope but did not handwrite their name, their address, and\/or date, <em>where no fraud or irregularity has been alleged<\/em>.\u201d . . . That holding undermines the Campaign\u2019s suggestions that defective ballots should not have been counted.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is also worth noting that, when this issue was argued in the lower state court on November 13, at stake were just 8,329 votes. Counsel conceded that the campaign was \u201cnot proceeding based on allegations of fraud or misconduct.\u201d She did not question either the eligibility of the voters or the timeliness of the ballots; the campaign made clear that it was only \u201calleging that the ballots were not filled out correctly.\u201d (See Petition, Appendix A, pp 13\u201314.) We do not know from the petition how many non-compliant ballots there were statewide, but there is no allegation that they would have totaled enough to approach Biden\u2019s 80,000-vote victory margin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"nr-heading\">Other Issues<\/p>\n<p>There is no point belaboring the other claims curtly raised in the campaign\u2019s petition. Its equal-protection claims were rejected by the Third Circuit and would, in any event, face a <em>Bognet<\/em> hurdle on standing. Its \u201csubstantive due process\u201d claim is contingent on the election\u2019s having been conducted in a manner that reached \u201cthe point of patent and fundamental unfairness,\u201d a conclusion unsupported by the petition (to say nothing of the prior lawsuits).<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the petition &#8212; like the Trump campaign\u2019s post-election strategy in general &#8212; seems more a diatribe. Without mounting a convincing legal case for Supreme Court intervention, the petition exhorts the justices that, in \u201cthese tumultuous times,\u201d they owe it to the country to jump into the fray. Darkly, the campaign asserts that not \u201csince the election of 1860\u201d (i.e., not since the election on the eve of the Civil War) has the nation been so \u201cdeeply divided.\u201d It is chilling rhetoric.<\/p>\n<p>The campaign goes on to insist (relying on a poll recently generated \u201cby the reputable Rasmussen polling firm\u201d) that 47 percent of Americans believe it \u201cwas \u2018likely\u2019 or \u2018very likely\u2019 the election was stolen from the current incumbent president.\u201d However reliable this may be, there is no discussion of how much the incumbent president may have contributed to such sentiments by ceaselessly asserting that the election was \u201crigged\u201d by massive fraud &#8212; an allegation the campaign has failed to prove in court, demurring when given opportunities to present whatever evidence it may have.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__inner\"><span class=\"ad-unit--inline__label\">Advertisement<\/span> <\/p>\n<div class=\"dfp-ad dfp-inline_3\" >\n<div data-react-component=\"AdUnitVisibility\" data-unit=\"inline_3\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" class=\"\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--center ad-unit--inline\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__inner\"><span class=\"ad-unit--inline__label\">Advertisement<\/span> <\/p>\n<div class=\"dfp-ad dfp-inline_4_mobile\" >\n<div data-react-component=\"AdUnitVisibility\" data-unit=\"inline_4_mobile\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" class=\"\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<p>The petition does, however, repeat familiar campaign talking points: President Trump won both Florida and Ohio, becoming only the second candidate ever to do so while losing the election; even though these are normally closely contested \u201cswing states,\u201d the president won them comfortably; he won a large majority of \u201cbellwether\u201d counties that \u201calmost always [go] for the candidate who wins the election\u201d; and \u201che won 26 percent of non-white voters, the highest percentage for any Republican candidate since 1960.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One can easily imagine counterclaims focused on the unique intensity of the president\u2019s unpopularity among his large opposition, and the effect that clearly had on historic voter turnout &#8212; Biden\u2019s unprecedented haul of 81 million popular votes, along with the fact that no candidate has ever lost the popular vote by 7 million yet won an electoral majority. But whatever the merits may be of these competing contentions, <em>they are not legal arguments.<\/em> Far from persuading the Supreme Court to grant the petition, they will only reconfirm the justices\u2019 apparent conviction that this is a toxic political dispute &#8212; one they need not entertain and want no part of.<\/p>\n<div class=\"article-social-comment\">\n<nav

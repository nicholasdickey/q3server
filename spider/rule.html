His event in Atlanta with Mr. Warnock on Thursday is viewed by Democrats as an ironclad way to ensure that Black voters, a must-win constituency in the state, remain enthusiastic, despite back-to-back elections and runoffs that have sent Georgia voters to the polls four times in the last two years.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Mr. Warnock and Mr. Walker are contending with a shortened campaign schedule: Last year’s Senate runoff period lasted nine weeks, but the state’s new election law cut the time to four weeks. Each party has deployed a wealth of resources to the state, including millions of dollars in advertising and close to 1,000 new field staffers.</p><div><section role="complementary" class="css-1px5j0" aria-label="What to Know About Georgia’s&nbsp;Senate Runoff"><div class="css-76fnlk"><h2 class="css-1gcsvhw">What to Know About Georgia’s&nbsp;Senate Runoff</h2></div><div id="storyline-context-container" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Card 1 of 6</span><div data-scrolled-index="0" class="swiper css-o7i5g3"><div class="css-m541wo"><div class="css-1w3yqu0" aria-hidden="false"><div><div class="css-1pcai02" data-testid="context-card"><p class="css-1t83a55"><strong>Another runoff in Georgia.<!-- --> </strong><span>The contest&nbsp;between Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and his Republican opponent, Herschel Walker, will be decided in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/us/politics/georgia-runoff-warnock-walker.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-georgia-senate-runoff&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">Dec. 6 runoff</a>.

Crime is up.
